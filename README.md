MVC .NET C# Project

This project is built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, utilizing .NET and C# technologies. The application is designed to meet the requirements of a task that involves various calculations and data display based on user inputs.

Features

1. Nav Bar

The navigation bar includes the following sections:

Qyteti (City)

Pensioni (Pension)

Shuma (Amount)


2. Qyteti (City)

Users can choose between two cities. Clicking on either city will take the user to a corresponding page showing the details for that city.
Additionally, users can view the historical data of the selected city on a separate page.

3. Pensioni (Pension)
   
A form is provided where the user enters their details to calculate their retirement age or the number of years they have already been retired.
Based on the user's input, the system will calculate and display the relevant information.

4. Shuma (Amount)
In this section, users can input an amount of money. The system then calculates how that amount can be split into denominations of 500, 200, 100, 50, 20, 10, and 5.
The output will show how many of each denomination fit into the total amount.
